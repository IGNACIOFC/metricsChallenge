# Challenge

Hi! I'm going to present you the result of my challenge:

I was trying to find a good idea that can match the tech requisites and keep the business scope. With that in mind, I thought of selling an ebook for people interested in building HR Teams.


Fulfilling the requirements, the metrics of downloads and sales are saved in a database and then the data is portrayed in a nice bar chart. At the same time we get the values of average sales per minute, hour and day.

Hope you like it!

## Technologies used
 
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB


## Installation

Download the project directory, add the database link to the variable mongodbURL in ./api/src/config.js and run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm run start:api
npm run start:client
```
To run the project I will send you the link of my database.
